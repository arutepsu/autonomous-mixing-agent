"""Deterministic metadata preflight for one bounded gain/full-mix execution.

``preflight_execution`` is pure: it reads only the request records, invokes no processor, touches
no file and allocates nothing. Its success result is deliberately named ``MetadataReady``: it does
not prove file integrity or hashes, sample alignment, authorization against external state that may
have changed since, workspace safety or collision freedom, or exclusive access. A future execution
service must establish those immediately before processing and recheck state before publication.
