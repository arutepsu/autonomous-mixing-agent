"""Read-only verification of one WAV artifact against its declared ``AudioArtifact`` metadata.

The file is opened once, its bytes are captured with a bounded read, the SHA-256 of that captured
payload is compared with ``AudioArtifact.content_hash``, and the same in-memory payload is inspected
and decoded. This establishes the identity of the captured payload only: it does not prove that the
pathname still holds those bytes afterwards, and it is not file-write protection (F4 stays open). A
later processor must consume the returned samples or reverify what it reads. Contributes to QR-01,
QR-02, QR-03, FR-02 and FR-17 without completing them; nothing is written, renamed or removed.

Only explicit absolute local paths are accepted. The lexical checks reject relative, URI-style and
UNC/device-namespace locations; they do not confine access to any directory and do not rule out
aliases, symbolic links, junctions or other reparse points. Regular-file checks are made on the
pathname and on the opened handle, but no safety against concurrent modification is claimed.

``max_file_bytes`` bounds the captured payload and ``max_decoded_bytes`` the returned float64 sample
storage; neither bounds total interpreter or libsndfile memory use. Both are caller-supplied: no
default or scientific threshold is implied.
