# Architectural decision records

One file per decision, named `NNNN-short-title.md`. Accepted ADRs are not edited; a change is a new ADR that supersedes the old one, and both are noted in this index ([ADR-003](0003-documentation-governance.md), [ADR-007](0007-docs-folder-structure.md)). File paths mentioned inside an ADR refer to the repository layout at the time it was written.
