"""Architecture tests for the application component packages and the infrastructure audio modules.

Contains the test-only import checker ``find_import_violations``. It resolves absolute, relative,
from-package and aliased imports against the real source tree (plus fixture-only look-alike modules),
matches exact package segments and enforces:

- the application component matrix (shared: none; observation: shared; decision: shared;
  admission: decision; execution: decision, admission), public-interface-only access across
  components, sibling-module (not own-interface) access within a component;
- the compatibility exception: the application root and the legacy modules may re-export from
  component interfaces, and component code never imports them;
- the infrastructure source rules: the descriptive ``infrastructure`` initializer imports nothing;
  ``audio`` re-exports its two leaves; ``dsp`` uses the standard library and NumPy only;
  ``verification`` uses the standard library, NumPy, soundfile and the ``domain.project`` interface.

These are source-import rules. The ``audio`` facade loads both leaves eagerly, so importing it is not
claimed to avoid loading soundfile.
